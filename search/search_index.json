Note This project is part of the reference implementation solution to demonstrate the IBM event driven reference architecture but it also presents how to combine different IBM cloud paks to build the solution: Cloud pak for data, for automation, for integration and for application. As we will detail in next section there are four components in this solution that make the anomaly detection: a Reefer simulator (we do not have such Reefer container in our stock), a container microservice, an analytics scoring agent and a business process. The diagram below is a very high level view of the components in a three layer architecture with Openshift for the deployment infrastructure. We also look at an open source version of this solution using an approach close to opendatahub.io proposed architecture, as illustrated in the following diagram: The Reefer container is an IoT device, which emits container telemetries every 10 minutes via the MQTT protocol. The first component receiving those messages is Apache Nifi to transform the telemetry message to a kafka event. Kafka is used as the event backbone and event sourcing so microservices, deployed on Openshift, can consume and publish messages. For persistence reason, we may leverage big data type of storage like Postgresql or Cassandra to persist the container's telemetry over a longer time period. This datasource is used by the Data Scientists to do its data preparation and build training and test sets and select the best model. We also illustrate how to connect to Kafka topic as data source, from a Jupyter notebook. Data scientists can run Jupyter lab on OpenShift and build a model to be deployed as python microservice, consumer of Reefer telemetry events. When anomaly is detected, a new event is posted to the containers topic so the Reefer container manager microservice can apply the expected business logic. MVP component view For a minimum viable demonstration the runtime components looks like in the figure below: A web app, deployed on Openshift, is running a simulator to simulate the generation of Reefer container telemetries while the container is at sea or during end to end transportation. The app exposes a simple POST operation with a control object to control the simulation. Here is an example of such control.json object { 'containerID': 'C02', 'simulation': 'co2sensor', 'nb_of_records': 1000, \"product_id\" : \"P02\" } The simulation can be done on o2sensor, co2sensor or power. A curl script does the HTTP POST request of this json object. See this paragraph. The telemetry events are sent to the reeferTelemetries topic in Kafka. The predictive scoring is a consumer of such events, read one event at a time and call the model internally, then sends a new event when maintenance is required. See the note for details. The maintenance requirement is an event in the containers topic. The 6 th component of the solution, is the container microservice which was defined in the EDA reference implementation. The maintenance engineer intervention process is modeled in BPM, deploy on public cloud and the process application is exposed as API. The container identifier and the telemetry record is sent as input to the process. Pre-requisites to build and run this solution Start by cloning this project using the command: git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-reefer-ml Be sure to have Event Stream or a Kafka cluster running somewhere We recommend creating the Event Stream service using the IBM Cloud catalog , you can also read our quick article on how to deploy event stream. As an alternate approach, we have deployed Event Stream on Openshift running on-premise servers following the product documentation here . The following diagram illustrates the needed Kafka topics configured in IBM Cloud Event Stream service: With IBM Cloud deployment use the service credentials to create new credentials to get the Kafka brokers list, the admin URL and the api key needed to authenticate the consumers and the producers. For Event Streams on Openshift deployment, click to the connect to the cluster button to get the broker URL and to generate the API key: select the option to generate the key for all topics. Provision a Postgresql service If you plan to use Postgresql as a data source instead of using csv file, then you need to provision a Postgresql service in IBM Cloud. Use the product documentation to provision your own service. Define service credential and use the composed url, the database name and the SSL certificate. Use the following commands to get the certificate: ibmcloud login ibmcloud cdb cacert <database deployment name> Save this file as postgres.pem under the simulator folder. Set environment variables As part of the 12 factors practice , we externalize the end points configuration in environment variables. We are providing a script template ( scripts/setenv-tmp.sh ) to set those variables for your local development. Rename this file as setenv.sh . This file is git ignored, to do not share keys and passwords in public domain. The variables help the different code in the solution to access the Event Stream broker cluster and the Postgresql service running on IBM Cloud. Building a python development environment as docker image To avoid impacting our laptop environment (specially macbook which use python), we use a dockerfile to get the basic of python 3.7.x and the python modules like kafka, http requests, pandas, sklearn, pytest... we need to develop and test the different python code of this solution. To build your python image with all the needed libraries, use the following commands: cd docker docker build -f docker-python-tools -t ibmcase/python . To use this python environment you can use the script: startPythonEnv . When running with Event Stream and Postgres on the cloud use IBMCLOUD argument: # refarch-reefer-ml project folder ./startPythonEnv.sh IBMCLOUD Build the docker image for Jupyter notebook We are using a special version of conda to add the postgresql and kafka libraries for python so we can access postgresql or kafka from notebook. The Dockerfile may use a cert.pem file, which contains the postgres certificate so the notebook can connect to postgresql service with SSL connection. cd docker docker build -f docker-jupyter-tool -t ibmcase/jupyter . To run this jupyter server use the startJupyterServer.sh script: # refarch-reefer-ml project folder ./startJupyterServer.sh IBMCLOUD Create the postgresql database If you use POSTGRESQL on IBM Cloud, you need to get the SSL certificate and put it as postgres.pem under the simulator folder, or set POSTGRES_SSL_PEM to the path where to find this file. The postgres.pem file needs to be in the simulator folder. Run the ReeferRepository.py tool to create the database schema and to add some reference data like the product catalog: ./startPythonEnv.sh IBMCLOUD > python simulator/infrastructure/ReeferRepository.py You should see the following trace: Connect remote with ssl ('PostgreSQL 10.10 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) 6.3.0 20170516, 64-bit',) [ { \"container_id\": \"C01\", \"last_maintenance_date\": null, \"reefer_model\": \"20RF\" }, { \"container_id\": \"C02\", \"last_maintenance_date\": null, \"reefer_model\": \"20RF\" }, { \"container_id\": \"C03\", \"last_maintenance_date\": null, \"reefer_model\": \"40RH\" }, { \"container_id\": \"C04\", \"last_maintenance_date\": null, \"reefer_model\": \"45RW\" } ] [ { \"content_type\": 1, \"description\": \"Carrots\", \"product_id\": \"P01\", \"target_humidity_level\": 0.4, \"target_temperature\": 4.0 }, { \"content_type\": 2, \"description\": \"Banana\", \"product_id\": \"P02\", \"target_humidity_level\": 0.6, \"target_temperature\": 6.0 }, { \"content_type\": 1, \"description\": \"Salad\", \"product_id\": \"P03\", \"target_humidity_level\": 0.4, \"target_temperature\": 4.0 }, { \"content_type\": 2, \"description\": \"Avocado\", \"product_id\": \"P04\", \"target_humidity_level\": 0.4, \"target_temperature\": 6.0 } ] ('public', 'reefers', 'ibm-cloud-base-user', None, True, False, True, False) ('public', 'products', 'ibm-cloud-base-user', None, True, False, True, False) ('public', 'reefer_telemetries', 'ibm-cloud-base-user', None, True, False, True, False) Project approach The solution covers different development areas and practices: event driven microservice, business process, data ops and machine learning model development.

You will learn how to simulate date for reefer, develop the predictive maintenance model, and integrate the model into an application. Introduction A reefer container is a refrigerated shipping container used to store or transport frozen or cold goods perishable items or goods that require temperature control. Reefers make an excellent, portable solution for short or long term storage and can be used to ship or truck goods over long distances as they can be plugged into the power station on ships or have it clipped on generators attached. Perishable products must be kept at a controlled temperature, from point of origin to delivery to retailer or pharmacy. The logistics industry refers to this as the \u201ccold chain\u201d and it encompasses both \u201creefers\u201d (refrigerated containers) as well as warehouses, distribution centers and the final storage or holding areas. Throughout this chain the risk of failure is ever-present, meaning there is always a possibility of cargo exceeding permissible or safe temperature levels, even if only briefly. For example, a truck might be stopped without power in desert heat, allowing temperatures in the reefer to rise. Then power is restored and the temperature in the container comes back down, but the product is damaged. When cargo with such as any of those items listed above are exposed to temperatures outside of prescribed limits it can be damaged. In some cases this is evident, such as with bananas, but in other situations, like the transport of vaccines, it may not be apparent that damage has occurred and the vaccine becomes ineffective. For some products, going over temperature, even only briefly, can reduce shelf life dramatically, incurring substantial costs when it cannot be sold. Organizations contracting to ship perishable products often specify the permissible temperature range. However, even if it is possible to show that product was exposed to conditions outside of those contracted, proving where it happened, and thus responsibility, can be much harder. Predictive maintenance problem statement If you want a good understanding of the problem space for predictive maintenance read, Yana Ageeva's article in toward data science . The success of predictive maintenance models depend on three main components: having the right data framing the problem appropriately evaluating the predictions properly From a methodology point of view the Data Scientist needs to address the following questions: What type of failure to consider and which one to predict? What kind of failure is happening? slow degradation or instantaneous failure? What could be the relation between a product characteristics and the failure? What kind of measure exist to assess the given characteristic? Which measurements correspond to good functioning and which ones correspond to failure? How often metrics are reported? What question the model should answer? What kind of output should the model give? How long in advance should the model be able to indicate that a failure will occur? What are the business impact to do not predict the failure? and predicting false negative failure? What is the expected accuracy? Reefer problem types There are multiple different potential issues that could happen to a refrigerator container. We are choosing to model the \"Sensor Malfunctions\" issue: Sensors in the refrigeration unit need to be calibrated and be continuously operational. An example of failure may come from the air sensor making inaccurate readings of temperatures, which leads to sploiled content. A potential reason may come from a faulty calibration, which can go unnoticed for a good time period. It may be difficult to know if there is an issue or not. The other common potential issues are: Fluid leaks, like engine oil, coolant liquid. The preassure sensors added to the circuit may help identify preassure lost over time. Faulty belts and hoses. Faulty calibration: A non-calibrated reefer can cool at a slower or faster rate than desired. Damaged Air Chute. Condenser Issues like broken or damaged coils, clamps or bolts missing, and leaks. Door Seals damaged. Blocked air passage: to keep the temperature homogenous inside the reefer. So the question we want to answer is: does the Reefer keep accurate temperature overtime between what is set versus what is measured? Modeling techniques The model uses the generated data from above scenarios: When the container's door is open for a longer time - this gives a false positive that maintainence is required. When sensors are malfunctioning, it records arbitrary readings. When the readings are normal. We have currently trained our model on 3000 datapoints from the three scenarios above. There are different modeling approach to tackle predictive maintenance: regression model classification to predict failure for a given time period classify anomalous behavior: classes are not known in advance. Normal operation is known. compute probability of failure over time Code execution The simulator continuosly generates container metrics, publishes it to Kafka and run the predictMaintainence.ipynb to predict if maintainence is sought at this point in time. Model description We are using Machine Learning supervised learning here. There are two types of supervised learning - 1) Classification: Predict a categorical response, 2) Regression: Predict a continuous response Linear regression Pros: 1) Fast 2) No tuning required 3) Highly interpretable 4) Well-understood Cons: 1) Unlikely to produce the best predictive accuracy 2) Presumes a linear relationship between the features and response 3) If the relationship is highly non-linear as with many scenarios, linear relationship will not effectively model the relationship and its prediction would not be accurate Naive Bayes classification Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier inspired by the Bayes theorem under a simple assumption which is the attributes are conditionally independent. The classification is conducted by deriving the maximum posterior which is the maximal P(Ci|X) with the above assumption applying to Bayes theorem. This assumption greatly reduces the computational cost by only counting the class distribution. Even though the assumption is not valid in most cases since the attributes are dependent, surprisingly Naive Bayes has able to perform impressively. Naive Bayes is a very simple algorithm to implement and good results have obtained in most cases. It can be easily scalable to larger datasets since it takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers. Naive Bayes can suffer from a problem called the zero probability problem. When the conditional probability is zero for a particular attribute, it fails to give a valid prediction. This needs to be fixed explicitly using a Laplacian estimator. Model evaluation We are using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for evaluating the model performance. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is the square root of the mean of the squared errors. Classification does better here as the scenarion is more of a classification problem.

We are choosing to model the \"Sensor Malfunctions\" issue: Sensors in the refrigeration unit need to be calibrated and be continuously operational. An example of failure may come from the air sensor making inaccurate readings of temperatures, which leads to sploiled content. A potential reason may come from a faulty calibration, which can go unnoticed for a good time period. It may be difficult to know if there is an issue or not. The other common potential issues are: Fluid leaks, like engine oil, coolant liquid. The preassure sensors added to the circuit may help identify preassure lost over time. Faulty belts and hoses. Faulty calibration: A non-calibrated reefer can cool at a slower or faster rate than desired. Damaged Air Chute. Condenser Issues like broken or damaged coils, clamps or bolts missing, and leaks. Door Seals damaged. Blocked air passage: to keep the temperature homogenous inside the reefer.

The classification is conducted by deriving the maximum posterior which is the maximal P(Ci|X) with the above assumption applying to Bayes theorem. This assumption greatly reduces the computational cost by only counting the class distribution. Even though the assumption is not valid in most cases since the attributes are dependent, surprisingly Naive Bayes has able to perform impressively. Naive Bayes is a very simple algorithm to implement and good results have obtained in most cases. It can be easily scalable to larger datasets since it takes linear time, rather than by expensive iterative approximation as used for many other types of classifiers. Naive Bayes can suffer from a problem called the zero probability problem. When the conditional probability is zero for a particular attribute, it fails to give a valid prediction.

Map to the IP address of the kubernetes proxy server end point. An alternate approach is to setup a CI/CD pipeline We have adopted the Git Action to manage the continuous integration , and ArgoCD for the continuous deployment. The build process will build the following images: [https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ibmcase/kcontainer-reefer-simulator] Helm charts are added for the simulator and the scoring agent, using helm create command, and then the values.yaml and deployment.yaml files were updated to set environment variables and other parameters.

The test looks like: serv = PredictService() header=\"\"\"Timestamp, ID, Temperature(celsius), Target_Temperature(celsius), Power, PowerConsumption, ContentType, O2, CO2, Time_Door_Open, Maintenance_Required, Defrost_Cycle\"\"\" event=\"2019-04-01 T16:29 Z,1813, 101, 4.291843460900875,4.4,0,10.273342381017777,3,4334.920958996634,4.9631508046318755,1,0,6\"\"\" record=header+\"\\n\"+event print(serv.predict(record)) So the scoring works, now we need to code the scoring application that will be deployed to Openshift cluster, and which acts as a consumer of container metrics events and a producer container events. The Scoring Agent code of this app is ScoringAgent.py module. It starts a consumer to get messages from Kafka. And when a message is received, it needs to do some data extraction and transformation and then use the predictive service. During the tests we have issue in the data quality, so it is always a good practice to add a validation function to assess if all the records are good. For production, this code needs to be enhanced for better error handling an reporting. Run locally Under scoring\\eventConsumer folder, set the environment variables for KAFKA using the commands below: (It uses event streams on IBM Cloud) export KAFKA_BROKERS=broker-3.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-1.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-0.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-5.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-2.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-4.eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093 export KAFKA_APIKEY=\"set-api-key-for-eventstreams-on-cloud\" docker run -e KAFKA_BROKERS=$KAFKA_BROKERS -e KAFKA_APIKEY=$KAFKA_APIKEY -v $(pwd)/..:/home -ti ibmcase/python bash -c \"cd /home/scoring && export PYTHONPATH=/home && python ScoringAgent.py\" Scoring: Build and run on Openshift The first time we need to add the application to the existing project, run the following command: oc new-app python:latest~https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-reefer-ml.git --context-dir=scoring/eventConsumer --name reeferpredictivescoring This command will run a source to image, build all the needed yaml files for the kubernetes deployment and start the application in a pod. It use the --context flag to define what to build and run. With this capability we can use the same github repository for different sub component. As done for simulator, the scoring service needs environment variables. We can set them using the commands oc set env dc/reeferpredictivescoring KAFKA_BROKERS=$KAFKA_BROKERS oc set env dc/reeferpredictivescoring KAFKA_APIKEY=$KAFKA_APIKEY oc set env dc/reeferpredictivescoring KAFKA_CERT=/opt/app-root/src/es-cert.pem but we have added a script for you to do so. This script needs only to be run at the first deployment. It leverage the common setenv scripts: ../scripts/defEnvVarInOpenShift.sh The list of running pods should show the build pods for this application: oc get pods reeferpredictivescoring-1-build 1/1 Running 0 24s To run the build again after commit code to github: oc start-build reeferpredictivescoring # or from local file system oc start-build reeferpredictivescoring --from-file=. To see the log: oc logs reeferpredictivescoring-2-rxr6j To be able to run on Openshift, the APP_FILE environment variable has to be set to ScoringApp.py. This can be done in the environment file under the .s2i folder. The scoring service has no API exposed to the external world, so we do not need to create a Route or ingress. See the integration test section to see a demonstration of the solution end to end. Build docker images Build each docker images, publish them to docker hub registry or private registry, and then refresh the app in openshift. Which translates as the following command sequence: # simulator folder docker build -t ibmcase/reefersimulator . docker login docker push ibmcase/reefersimulator > The push refers to repository [docker.io/ibmcase/reefersimulator] For the scoring agent: # scoring folder Run kafka on your laptop For development purpose, you can also run kafka, zookeeper and postgresql and the solution on your laptop.
